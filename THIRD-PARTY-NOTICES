This project is based on the Composio plugin from:
https://github.com/ComposioHQ/openclaw-composio

That repository is a fork of OpenClaw with the Composio plugin added by the
ComposioHQ team. The repository-level MIT license (Copyright (c) 2025 Peter
Steinberger) covers the OpenClaw codebase, not the Composio plugin specifically.

The Composio plugin code (under extensions/composio/) was authored by ComposioHQ.
We include the repo's MIT license below as it covers the repository as a whole:
